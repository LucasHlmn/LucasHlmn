## Hi, I'm Lucas 👋

I'm currently working as a FP&A / Business Analyst but I have a strong interest to Data Science/Analytics, Machine Learning and BlockChain applications. Most of projects I completed so far were done using **Python, C and UNIX Shell.**

I'm also a student at 42 School(Tokyo campus) on my freetime. 42 is a future-proof computer science training to educate the next generation of software engineers. The 42 program takes a project-based approach to progress and is designed to develop technical and people skills that match the expectations of the labor market. Its pedagy revolves around 4 main pillars: 

1. No Courses, no teachers and no classes
2. Project-based Pedagogy
3. Peer-to-Peer Learning
4. Gamification
